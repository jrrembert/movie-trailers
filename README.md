# movie-trailers
A simple site to view and watch movie trailers

Note: current site is only a POC with hard-coded data. Dynamic loading of 
      movie data will be built in once account access to the Rotten Tomatoes
      API is approved.
      
For now you can check out the site's WIP [here](https://jrrembert.github.io/movie-trailers).

**9/22/2015 Update: Access to RT API denied so it doesn't appear I'll be doing too much with this in the near future.**

### Installation

Pretty simple assuming you have Python installed:

1. Clone repo: ```git clone https://github.com/jrrembert/movie-trailers.git```
2. Build HTML: ```python movie-trailers/src/entertainment_center.py```

Python 2 vs 3 shouldn't matter, but drop a comment in issues if you run into something.
